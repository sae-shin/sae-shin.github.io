      <h3>A love story about HtM.L and C.S.S</h3>
      <img src="../images/heart.png" alt="Pink Fuzzy heart" style="width:600px; height:auto;">
      <p>It was the year 3022 and Harry yelped as he painfully stubbed a toe while carrying a large over-filled box through the doorway. Harry's partner, Chidi giggled at this act of clumsiness. They were finally moving in together and Chidi could tell that this was going to be an adjustment but fun nonetheless.</p>
      <p>Htm.L short for Harrison The Millionth Ludwig, known to friends as Harry, was the millionth Harrison in a long line of Ludwigs. Their family were a very no-nonsense, straight to the point people and passed down a set of traditions, some of which had become outdated and old-fashioned, but which for the most part Harry still followed.</p>
      <p>When Harry met Chidi they were a classic example of opposites attract. Chidi Shennong Smith was adopted by a creative artist who instilled in Chidi a passion to find beauty in everything. For Chidi, even a box could be filled in just the right way to make it look pleasing to they eye. Not too empty, and not filled in such an orderly way to look boring. A box could have just the right proportion of contents to convey the feeling that it was connected to and part of a hugely momentous day: Moving in day for Harry and Chidi.</p>
      <p>Harry was a stark contrast and was more concerned with the practical and what the boxes were being filled with. Not wanting to bring anything unnecessary to their new apartment, Harry was systematic in ensuring only what was needed to set up their new home was making it inside. And of course, everything was perfectly organised into the rooms of their destination. Things for the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom did not mix and were carefully labeled.</p>

      <p>If an outsider was to observe this scene through a window, they would see the magic of this relationship and the limitless potential of these two in building their life together.</p>
