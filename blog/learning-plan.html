      <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
      <p>My long term goal is to be able to create and work in a way that can help people. I’d like to be able to either start my own business or be contracted to an organisation that can support small businesses that don’t have as many resources to be able to embrace technology, the internet and social media to become successful.</p>
      <p>My career pathway will be to get a junior developer job following Dev Academy and then to continue building my design and UI knowledge.</p>
      
      <h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
      <p>A strength and limitation of mine in learning is how much detail I like to dive into. I like delivering things to a high quality but sometimes this means that I can lose myself in the flow of something or get swamped trying to get something just exactly right. I’m learning to let go of some of that control, trust that I can revise some things later, and that done is better than perfect. This concept applies to learning new things too, as I’m in the process of practicing how to understand something just enough, and then let myself move on.</p>
      
      <h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
      <p>I’d like to see my skills in connecting with others developed by becoming better at sharing things about myself and demonstrating authenticity.</p>
      
      <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h4>
      <p>My commitment is to be structured in my days so that I have clear work times and a good amount of breaks and time away from my desk for my wellbeing. I commit to being focused during the times that I schedule to be working.
      I will stay in touch with my peers and facilitators to let them know how I’m going and not hide away any issues or concerns that I’m having.
      When things start building up, I’ll notice and acknowledge what is difficult and then if possible address it by time boxing my tasks. If there’s still more that is building, I’ll make sure to reach out to a tutor and ask for help.</p>
      
      <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
      <p>How I’ll seek help is to reach out to a tutor or if more appropriate, people in my group that may be able to help me - or both!</p>
      
      <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
      <p>I expect to be able to ask questions and be guided or supported in the best way for me to learn a concept. I expect to be able to be given feedback or advice if there’s anything that they see as good for my development or skills.</p>
      <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
      <p>None.</p>
