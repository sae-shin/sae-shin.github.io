      <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
      <p>Just like the misconception that intelligence is fixed, EQ is also overlooked as an area of our life that has the potential to be developed in order to vastly improve the quality of our short existence here.</p>
      <p>I see it as life long learning.</p>
      <p>It’s the ability to understand behaviours of ourselves and others by learning and practicing the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to interpret ourselves</li>
        <li>Where our emotions arise from</li>
        <li>How our childhoods influence us</li>
        <li>How we might best navigate our fears and wishes</li>  
      </ul>
      <p>This video from School of Life explains the importance of emotional intelligence and for me, put the idea in a new context of the dangerous way we have advanced in other areas.</p>
      <p>It talks about how we as a species have become so technically advanced and intelligent but by having neglected emotional education, we are evolved primates with nuclear weapons.</p>

      <p>It’s important that emotional intelligence catches up to our technological advances as otherwise we will become further beholden to the power of the technology or structures that we have created and that will inevitable master us if we don’t master ourselves.</p>
