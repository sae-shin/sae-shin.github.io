<!-- About Me -->
  <h2 id="aboutme">about me</h2>
  <p>Originally born in Seoul, South Korea, I moved to Christchurch, Aotearoa soon after my third birthday with my family of mum, dad, and two older sisters.</p>
  <p>Christchurch is a very peaceful and family-oriented city but it was and remains very homogenous in its population. Although Asian immigration was growing fast at the time, a lot of people chose to live in Auckland and at the time of our arrival in 1995, there were only a handful of Korean families in Christchurch. </p> 
  <p>My experience growing up as an immigrant in the Kiwi culture, especially as a little kid who wanted nothing more than to belong, shaped a lot of my experiences and had me grappling with my identity.</p>
  <p>I'm now 30, and seeing life in a whole new way as I become in equal parts more sure about who I am as well as completely humbled my life's uncertainty. I've found a new (yet these things are not really so new are they?) way to enjoy life and I'm revelling in it. One aspect of the new path that I am on is driven by a 4 month web development course with Dev Academy.</p>
  <p>Learning these new skills allows me to create through a whole new medium, and also lets me reflect and practice writing - something I really enjoy. I hope the sense of my excitement, gratitude and insight comes across in my subsequent blog posts and content. </p>
  <p>Please explore and enjoy!</p>
